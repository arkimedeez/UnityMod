Disclaimer: This mod is currently in the InDev phase. That means that the United Horizons Mod has a limited amount of content (for the time being). Much more equipment, and many more bosses, biomes, and future challenges are planned (future support for Calamity, Thorium, and other modded classes is also planned).

The Unitted Horizons Mod is a unique mod that is focused around the Omega class. It offers a unique way of playing the game, with new mechanics called Omega Attacks and Omega Charge, the latter of which is visually displayed under the player while holding a weapon from the Omega class. Omega attacks consume all of your Omega Charge in order to do anything your heart desires, depending on the weapon. Want to slash through your foes with a mighty swing that also grants complete invulnerability? You got it. Want to create swirling whirlpools of feathers around you that shred your opponents? It's all yours, my friend. Or maybe you're in the mood for a personal buff of some sort? Plenty of weapons got you covered.
The Omega Class aims to be able to be used either by itself for an entire playthrough, or alongside another class of any kind. Armor and equipment from the omega class benefits all other classes rather than just itself. Additionally, the omega class takes damage increases from all other classes.
With new, never before seen weapons with multiple attacks that can be used alongside any other class, this is a must have for any future playthrough.
